      <p>Hidden Hook is your source for premium flies. Every fly that leaves our shop is spun with top-of-the-line materials and components. At Hidden Hook we take pride in each fly that leaves the vice and guarantee their flawless performance. Each fly is hand tied by Hidden Hook founder Rudy Babikian.   </p>

      <p>Rudy was taught how to tie simple patterns when he was still shuffling around in a diaper. He was given his first tying vice when he was five years old by his father, George Babikian, an avid fly fisherman. Through his continued passion of fishing and tying, Rudy has become an accomplished tyer himself. See some of his favorite flies below.</p>
